<p>Following up on Matt Reid's <a href="http://themattreid.com/wordpress/?p=330">simple python, mysql connection and iteration</a>, I would like to share one of my own, which is the base for mycheckpoint &amp; openark kit scripts.</p>
<p>It is oriented to provide with clean access to the data: the user is not expected to handle cursors and connections. Result sets are returned as python lists and dictionaries. It is also config file aware and comes with built in command line options.</p>
<p>I hope it comes to use: <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/my.py">my.py</a></p>

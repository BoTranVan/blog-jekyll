<p>My name is <a title="Shlomi Noach" href="http://code.openark.org/blog/?page_id=7">Shlomi Noach</a>. I am a developer, DBA, consultant and instructor.</p>
<p>code.openark.org is a place for thoughts and code sharing.</p>
<p>Some open source projects and code snippets I'm working on will be published in this site. Most of them will have to do with MySQL, or with MySQL accessing from Java &amp; Python.</p>
<p>Please stay tuned to this site. Hope to start publishing in a short while!</p>
<p>Shlomi</p>

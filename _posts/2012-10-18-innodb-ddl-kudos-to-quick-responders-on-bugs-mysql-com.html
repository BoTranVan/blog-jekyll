<p>Continuing my <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/experimenting-with-5-6-innodb-online-ddl-bugs-included">experiments with 5.6 InnoDB online DDL</a>, a bug which I've opened, and another which I commented on were quickly answered and explained by the Oracle/MySQL team.</p>
<p>On both accounts I'm happy to acknowledge the issue is resolved; in both cases I failed to produce a real bug scenario. Good lesson. <em>Kudos for quick and informative responses!</em></p>
<p>What's left of my experiment, then? Still a lot to check.</p>
<p>I am mainly still confused with which operations exactly can use <strong>LOCK=NONE</strong> (allowing for updated to table while <strong>ALTER</strong>ing). So far I am only able to produce <strong>ALTER</strong>s with <strong>LOCK=SHARED</strong>, meaning table is readable, but cannot be updated.</p>
<p>I will want to test speeds. I've so far been content with slow response times for queries over altered tables. How well will that endure under heavy load?</p>

<div>
<p>It's another new year by Jewish calendar. And what do I wish for in the following year?</p>
<ol>
<li>World peace</li>
<li>Good health to all</li>
<li>Have <em>some</em> way to turn <strong>SHOW</strong> commands into <strong>SELECT</strong> statements, server side. I'm fervently trying to hack around this. Stored routines, export/import from file, text manipulation, I don't care! I want to <strong>SELECT seconds_behind_master somehow</strong>. Without plugins.</li>
</ol>
<p>PS, none of my <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year">last year's wishes</a> came true. I'll settle for two out of three.</p>

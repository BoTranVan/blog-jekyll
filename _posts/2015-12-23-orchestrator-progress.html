<p>This comes mostly to reassure, having moved into GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator">orchestrator</a> development continues.</p>
<p>I will have the privilege of working on this open source solution in GitHub. There are a few directions we can take orchestrator to, and we will be looking into the possibilities. We will continue to strengthen the crash recovery process, and in fact I've got a couple ideas on drastically shortening Pseudo-GTID recovery time as well as other debts. We will look into yet other directions, which we will share. My new and distinguished team will co-work on/with orchestrator and will no doubt provide useful and actionable input.</p>
<p>Orchestrator continues to be open for pull requests, with a temporal latency in response time (it's the Holidays, mostly).</p>
<p>Some Go(lang) limitations (namely the import path, I'll blog more about it) will most probably imply some changes to the code, which will be well communicated to existing collaborators.</p>
<p>Most of all, we will keep orchestrator a generic solution, while keeping focus on what we think is most important - and there's some interesting vision here. Time will reveal as we make progress.</p>

<p>I happened on a query where, by mistake, an</p>
<p>[sql]<br />
SELECT ... ORDER BY x DESC LIMIT 1<br />
[/sql]</p>
<p>was written as</p>
<p>[sql]<br />
SELECT ... GROUP BY x DESC LIMIT 1<br />
[/sql]</p>
<p>And it took me by surprise to realize <strong>GROUP BY x DESC</strong> is a valid statement. I looked it up: yep! It's <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-modifiers.html">documented</a>.</p>
<p>In MySQL, <strong>GROUP BY</strong> results are sorted according to the group statement. You can override this by adding <strong>ORDER BY NULL</strong> (see <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/less-known-sql-syntax-and-functions-in-mysql">past post</a>). I wasn't aware you can actually control the sort order.</p>

<p>Based on a true story which happened quite while ago, and given the many conferences approaching, here's a listing of types of talks I happen to attend to, present, or asked to present.</p>
<p>There are many ways to ask one to "come &amp; speak". I can agree to most of them, but not all. Listing from most fluid, through more restrictive, down to extremely unreasonable.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We would like you to come &amp; speak of some MySQL related topic of your choosing.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I'm honored; I am free to choose whatever I like? That's fun, since I can pick up anything that interests me at the immediate moment. I feel humbled because of the trust I'm being given. But I must also work very hard to convince myself that my own talk is of quality; there's no one else to check up on me.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is a conference. There is a CfP. Please submit a talk. A committee will review it, and if it finds it good, we'll be happy to have you speak.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is great. Someone put a lot of effort into making a good conference. A group of professionals will review my submission: this will make sure that my submission is of quality, and that it actually matches the purpose of the conference. It is the best way to avoid disappointment on both sides.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We would like you to present to our company on these bullets. You must include A, B, and C in your talk.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is on the thin line between talking and consulting. I can expect people to ask in depth questions on A, B and C. It is an invited job. I must be very familiar and experienced with the material, or else I must turn it down.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is a conference, we would like to to present according to these guidelines. You must include A, B and C.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As long as A, B and C are of interest to me, and I am allowed to add my own opinion on using them as opposed to using D, this can work out. I might wish to add E &amp; F to the talk if I feel they are missing.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is a conference, we would like to to present according to these guidelines, which include talking about this <strong>commercial</strong> product P.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>If I have the experience with P, and am allowed to express my personal opinion, this can still work out.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is a conference, we would like to to present according to these guidelines, which include talking about this commercial product P and P only, and why <strong>everyone should be using it</strong>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You strictly want me to be positive towards P, which can only work out if I truly am so extremely positive towards P. Talking about P but not of its competitors is morally sound, though it presents only a half truth.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb: if you want a sales pitch, there's no one more adequate to deliver it than an employee of the company producing P.</p>
<blockquote><p> <em>There is a conference, we would like to to present according to these guidelines, which include talking about <strong>our</strong> (or our <strong>partner's</strong>) commercial product P and P only, and why everyone should be using it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You really should get someone who works at your company to do that. I am willing to do it on two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, that I have true faith in P.</li>
<li>The second condition is so trivial, there's no need for me to mention it. Really, there's no need.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p> <em>There is a conference, we would like to to present according to these guidelines, which include talking about <strong>our</strong> (or our <strong>partner's</strong>) commercial product P and P only, and why everyone should be using it. And we don't pay you; it will be <strong>an honor for you</strong> to do this presentation. You do it for exposure.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is an easy one: if you would like <em>me</em> to talk about why everyone should be using <em>your</em> product, which is <em>commercial</em>, and you <em>make money</em> from people buying it, people who might be buying it following <em>my talk</em>, then you must offer payment. I didn't think I should mention it on the previous bullet.</p>
<p>This last one is actually real.</p>

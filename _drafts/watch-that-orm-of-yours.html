<p>ORMs (Object-Relational Mappings) are a way to hide underlying database structure and workings, and provide with programmer-friendly interface to handling database objects. Ideally, a programmer will never have to understand SQL, and will never care about the specific RDBMS implementation she is using.</p>
<p>Nothing is as simple, and ORMs are required to handle complicated cases &amp; understand the different RDBMS flavors. To a programmer, ORMs look cool. As a DBA, one finds drawbacks to using ORMs. Sometimes you just have to understand proper SQL or know your RDBMS if you want to make this work.</p>
<p>I wish to provide with some examples; I'll relate to <em>Hibernate</em>, a popular Java ORM, and <em>Django</em>, a python web framework which includes its own ORM implementation.</p>
<p>Hibernate:</p>
<p>- sql obfuscation with weird aliases</p>
<p>- duplicate and triple - indexes</p>
<p>django:</p>
<p>- check about offset/limit [20:10], with/out Pagination</p>
<p>- how about the COUNT(*) per bookmark example?</p>
<p>- django: creates AUTO_INCREMENT -- signed... why?</p>

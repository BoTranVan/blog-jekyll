<p>Do not that you are essentially breaking down a large query into many small ones (typically one-liners). Sometimes this is actually something you want to do!</p>
<p>multi-table update with LIMIT</p>
<p>do something ... where x in (select ...)--&gt; foreach('select ...', 'do something where x = ${1}');</p>

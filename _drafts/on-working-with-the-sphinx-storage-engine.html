<p>I've been working with <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/sphinx-mysql-facts-and-misconceptions">Sphinx &amp; MySQL</a> a lot lately, and I would like to shed some light on using the Sphinx Storage Engine (aka <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html#sphinxse">SphinxSE</a>).</p>
<p>The SphinxSE is a storage engine plugin</p>

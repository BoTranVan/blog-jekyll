<p>In <a title="Permanent Link to State of InnDB Online DDL in MySQL 5.6.9-RC (good news included)" href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/state-of-inndb-online-ddl-in-mysql-5-6-9-rc-good-news-included" rel="bookmark">State of InnDB Online DDL in MySQL 5.6.9-RC (good news included)</a> I found very encouraging online DDL for InnoDB behavior.</p>
<p>I tested ROW_FORMAT manipulation, adding and removing of indexes, adding and removing of columns. All went just well.</p>
<p>But I felt the experiment was incomplete, so I wanted to test the following additional DDL:</p>
<ul>
<li>MODIFY COLUMN: change an existing column from one datatype to another (say INT to BIGINT)</li>
<li>ADD CONSTRAINT: add foreign key constraints to a table</li>
<li>Repeat all tests on table with constraints</li>
</ul>

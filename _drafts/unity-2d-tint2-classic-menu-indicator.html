<p>In the past months I have kept being dissatisfied with the recent updates to the linux desktops.</p>
<p>Unity drove me crazy. Xfce felt right, but was still not quite mature, with a few annoying bugs. KDE, my historical favorite - too complex. Gnome 3 - I haven't tried in person. Enough to see my other half struggling to open up the correct terminal (one of three) to issue a <em>make</em> command. Ubuntu with classic gnome -- a thing I could practically live with forever -- exhausting my CPU.</p>
<p>And CPU exhaustion is, apparently, a big deal. Ubuntu with classic gnome is not the only one. KDE, yes, even with effects turned off (I don't want effects, I want to do software development), even with "High resolution and low CPU" setup (Ugh! Low CPU does not mean I don't want font antialiasing!), Gnome 3, Unity with Compiz... I mean, they all want to be so <em>smart</em>. Too smart.</p>
<p>I can hardly find my arms and legs in trying to configure my KDE desktop. So many options! And CCSM... Xfce getting the medal for being the sanest desktop around.</p>
<p>Unity 2D</p>
<p>I accidentally entered with a Unity 2D session. Here's the short summary of differences: it basically looks like Unity, but does not use Comiz. Alt-TAB is very basic (the way I like it) and does not group similar windows etc. You cannot resize icons on dash.</p>
<p>Oh. It does not kill my CPU.</p>
<p>And you can add the tint2 panel. I mean, you can add tint2 to Unity as well, but then it overlaps with the dash, unless you manually configure it to position itself just right after, in which case it looks funny if the dash is hidden, and, ... you get my point.</p>
<p>Unity 2D's dash respects tint2 by making itself shorter. Since I don't actually like nor need the dash for most of the time, I set it to auto-hide. Which leaves me with the top Unity panel, which becomes acceptable one the ClassicMenu indicator is added, and the bottom tint2 panel, showing my windows.</p>
<p>Tint2 respects the workspaces set up by Unity, which is good news. It doesn't work well with context menu (right click on task entry). But it gets the job done, and fairly seamlessly.</p>

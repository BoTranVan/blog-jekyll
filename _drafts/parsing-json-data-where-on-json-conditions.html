<p>Since MySQL follows the relational model, a table only has a fixed set of columns. Sometimes some versatility is needed, and you get these "all in one" text columns which contain arbitrary key:value pairs. I don't mean to dwell on the question whether the relational model is in place here, or whether a NoSQL solution fits better. The fact is, I've seen it in many places.</p>
<p>As for how these arbitrary values are stored, some use their own made up delimiter syntax (like <strong>'x=3;y=5;z=kaboom'</strong>) and are left with their own parsers and their own parsing errors. Others use XML, and utilize the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/xml-functions.html#function_extractvalue">ExtractValue()</a> function - but suffer from lengthy columns due to XML's inherent verbosity. Yet others use JSON, which is a well defined notatation, quite compact, very popular -- but lacks any support on MySQL.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/extract_json_value.html"><strong>extract_json_value()</strong></a>: it works much like <em>ExtractValue()</em>, only it works on valid JSON objects. This means you can do something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT 
  id, name 
FROM 
  my_customer_data 
WHERE 
  customer_id = 17 
  AND <strong>extract_json_value</strong>(additional_options_column, <span style="color: #800000;">'//priority_continent'</span>) = 'Europe'</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above, <strong>additional_options_column</strong> is a text column denoting a valid JSON object. We extract the value of <strong>"priority_continent"</strong> via XPath expression.</p>

<p>Highpages: startup and shutdown</p>
<p>This is an unconventional behavior, though not unlike InnoDB failing to load on non-matching transaction log files.</p>
<p>Naming conventions</p>
<p>Using MySQL internal names for tables, which makes incomprehensible file names (cannot deduce table name from file name) and need INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables to map table names to file names</p>
<p>File locations</p>
<p>All in the datadir. I would love to see table+index files placed within related schemas/directories</p>
<p>Compression</p>
<p>Anti-compression?!</p>
<p>You have normal compression and aggressive compression. Aggressive compression at about twice as space efficient than normal compression. However: when ALTER TABLE ENGINE=TokuDB and then ALTER TABLE ENGINE=TokuDB ROW_FORMAT=..., table size on disk does not decrease. So go directly from InnoDB to aggressive compression.</p>

<p>Asynchronous replication of specific MySQL tables across arbitrary servers -- not related by any MySQL replication topology.</p>
<p>With this tool you can distribute a table to one or more "target" servers</p>
<p>A new tool developed at Outbrain by my colleague Yonatan Maman and myself. Graciously released to open source.</p>

<p>Some queries make for hard work for MySQL. Using statement based replication often means whatever hard work was done by the master, needs to be re-done by the slave.</p>
<p>Assume the following situation: we have a very large table, and need to UPDATE some rows, on a certain condition. The condition does not utilize an index. For example:</p>
<pre>UPDATE logs SET</pre>
<p>Instead of DELETE FROM... WHERE (complicated)</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>SELECT FROM... WHERE (complicated)</p>
<p>DELETE FROM WHERE IN (primary keyy from previous result)</p>

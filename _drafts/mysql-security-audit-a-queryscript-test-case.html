<p>Following <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/common_schema-over-traditional-scripts">common_schema over traditional scripts</a>, I was interested in yet another aspect of server side rewriting of Python code. <em>openark kit</em> introduced <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/oak-security-audit.html">oak-security-audit</a>: a security audit of your MySQL server, checking up on accounts, passwords and general settings, resulting with a nice report.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this as a test case for <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/query_script.html">QueryScript</a>. How easy would it be to convert the well-working python script into <em>QueryScript</em> code?</p>
<p>I was surprised and pleased by the result. Numbers-wise, the audit (which is not identical, but nearly so), was reduced from <strong>448</strong> down to <strong>188</strong> lines of code. And Python code is quite compact. So where did I save up?</p>
<p>Naturally, all the connection stuff is gone, since I'm running from within the server. All the cursor stuff is gone. All the preparation of statements is gone. And, apparently <em>QueryScript</em>'s syntax does something right, since I managed to do most stuff very easily.</p>
<p>Lines of code are not everything, of course. Sometimes they're not <em>anything</em>. The code has to be clear, right? Then consider:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><strong>report h1</strong> <span style="color: #000080;">'Checking for non-local root accounts'</span>;
<strong>set</strong> @loop_counter := 0;
<strong>foreach</strong> ($user, $host: <strong>select</strong> user, host <strong>from</strong> mysql.user <strong>where</strong> user=<span style="color: #000080;">'root'</span> <strong>and</strong> host <strong>not</strong> <strong>in</strong> (<span style="color: #000080;">'127.0.0.1'</span>, <span style="color: #000080;">'localhost'</span>))
{
  <strong>if</strong> ((@loop_counter := @loop_counter+1) = 1) {
    <strong>report</strong> <span style="color: #000080;">'Recommendation: limit following root accounts to local machines'</span>;
  }
  <strong>report code</strong> <span style="color: #000080;">'rename '</span>, mysql_grantee($user, $host), <span style="color: #000080;">' to '</span>, quote($user), <span style="color: #000080;">'@'</span>, quote(<span style="color: #000080;">'localhost'</span>); 
}
<strong>otherwise</strong>
  <strong>report</strong> 'OK';</pre>

<p>My guess is that even if this is the first time you encounter <em>QueryScript</em>, you can easily figure out the above code. If not, that means I have more work to do :)</p>
<p>A sample security audit report looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; <strong>CALL</strong> security_audit();
